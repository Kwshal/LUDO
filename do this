short term:
<!-- - scale down the token, DONE -->
<!-- - current player token on top, DONE -->
<!-- - capture logic, ignore on stops, DONE -->
<!-- - auto Play when only option / only 1 token left, DONE -->
<!-- - extra turn logic, DONE -->
<!-- - openToken hasNoMove logic, DONE -->
<!-- - colored logic, DONE -->
<!-- - win logic, DONE -->
--- ghost logic,??? edit: ok so ghost token is the killed token which cant capture or be captured.
<!-- - conic gradient in finish square. DONE -->
- active token will have a dashed ring. NOT WORKING !!
- animate:
 <!-- - moves, DONE -->
 - capture !!!!!!
- online multiplayer !!!!!!!!
= animate dice ie slightly to the current player !!!!
 -- remove the current player status and denote it by other means !!!
 -- animate the dice roll !!!



probs:
<!-- - clicking the token without a diceNumber results in permanent disabled dice, FIXED -->
<!-- - captured tokens stacking at the same place in the homeSquare, FIXED -->
<!-- -  star too big inside the finished token. FIXED -->
- token not autoMoving even when it the only movable token !!!!!!
